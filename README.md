# password-generator
<br>
This project, which is Java-based, is a useful tool for making safe passwords. For users that want strong passwords for their online accounts, programmes, or any other security-related reason, it provides a simple and effective solution.
<br>
With the help of the program's user-friendly interface, users may customise the created password by providing criteria like length, character type (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, and special symbols), and any unusual characters that must be avoided. Once these options are selected, users may click the "Generate Password" button, and the application will generate a special, random password that satisfies their requirements.
